# Day 4: Is An Anagram

Here's the definition of an anagram: *a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.*

We are given two strings like "cinema" and "iceman" as inputs. Can you write a method `isAnagram(str1, str2)` that will return `true` or `false` depending on whether the strings are anagrams of each other?

## Test Cases

* `isAnagram('Mary', 'Army')` should return `true`
* `isAnagram('cinema', 'iceman')` should return `true`
* `isAnagram('jake', 'jay')` should return `false`
