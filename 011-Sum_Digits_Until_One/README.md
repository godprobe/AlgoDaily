# Day 11: Sum Digits Until One

We're provided a positive integer `num`. Can you write a method to repeatedly add all of its digits until the result has only one digit?

Here's an example: if the input was `49`, we'd got through the following steps:

```javascript
// start with 49
4 + 9 = 13

// move onto 13
1 + 3 = 4
```

We would then return 4.
